## [Unreleased]


## [0.2.1] - 2024-11-03
### Changed
- `tag!()` and `tag_mut!()` can now take dynamic expressions instead of just
  literals so they can be used with runtime-determined addresses.


## [0.2.0] - 2024-04-13
### Added
- Added `Debug` implementations for structs generated by `process_image!{}`.


## [0.1.1] - 2023-09-18
### Added
- Added implementations of `AsRef[u8]` and `AsMut<[u8]>` to the structs that
  are generated by `process_image!{}`.  This allows direct access to the
  underlying buffer when necessary.

### Fixed
- Fixed `From` and `TryFrom` not being referenced via fully qualified path in
  code that is generated by `process_image!{}`.


## [0.1.0] - 2023-09-09
